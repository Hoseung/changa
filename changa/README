To compile ChaNGa first compile Charm++ or get a precompiled version.  Also
build the "cache" module and the "liveViz" module in charm++, then run:

./configure
make (or gmake)

The executable ChaNGa will be created together with the submit script charmrun
(for most machines).

To run the code:

./charmrun +p <procs> ChaNGa <param.file> [ additional options ]

This will work on many machines, and can either be run directly or be
submitted through the local scheduler.  However, on some machines the
application will need to be submitted manually.

Several test simulations are included in subdirectories:
A small cosmological simulation is included in testcosmo.
A small globular cluster simulation is included in teststep.
For simple performance benchmarking, arbitrary size simulations can be done
in testdata.
An example simulation that generates movie frames is included in movie.
