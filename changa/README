To compile ChaNGa first compile Charm++ or get a precompiled version, then run:

./configure
make (or gmake)

The executable ChaNGa will be created together with the submit script charmrun
(for most machines).

To run the code:

./charmrun +p <procs> ChaNGa <param.file> [ additional options ]

This will work on many machines, and either run directly the application or
submit through the local scheduler. On some machines nevertheless the
application will need to be submitted manually.

More information are available in the online wiki:

Several test simulations are included in subdirectories:
A small cosmological simulation is included in testcosmo.
A small globular cluster simulation is included in teststep.
For simple performance benchmarking, arbitrary size simulations can be done
in testdata.
