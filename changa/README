Dependences:

CHARM (of course): edit Makefile to point at your charm version.

../structures: Do a "make" there first.

To run:

ParallelGravity -v -v -v -v -p 2 lambs.00200_subsamp_20000

The "-p" option indicates the number of "TreePieces", and therefore the number
of Charm array elements.


With the default parameters, at the end of the output you should get:

Error Bounds:1.02289e-06, 0.135807

to a couple of digits of accuracy.  This will indicate that the force errors
are reasonable, and the program is therefore correct.

"requestNode()" and "requestParticle()" need to be replaced with caching
versions.  If the requested object is in the cache, then these functions should
return it immediately.  Otherwise, the function should return "NULL" and
get then get the data from the remote processor.  See "fillRequestNode()" for
how to get the remote node.  After the data is returned then a callback should
be invoked (like receiveNode()).
