Structure: 
	   1. call CkStartCheckpoint() at intervals or when wall clock runs out.
	   2. restart() entry will detect if we're really restarting or not
	    by using a flag set in the Migration constructor for main and
	    then call doSimulation() to continue.
	  

Issues:
Does Readonly data get automatically checkpointed?
When does Main(CkMigrateMessage *) get called?
Why does CacheManager need a migration constructor and a PUPer?
Does DataManager also need this?
What about sorter?
What about the proxies that are stored read-only?
