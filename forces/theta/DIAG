ChaNGa version 3.2, commit v3.2-146-gd8e31c9
Running on 1 processors/ 1 nodes with 1 TreePieces
Charm++: standalone mode (not using charmrun)
Charm++> Running in SMP mode: numNodes 1,  1 worker threads per process
Charm++> The comm. thread only receives messages, while work threads send messages
Converse/Charm++ Commit ID: v6.8.0-beta1-200-g374ff1a
Warning> Randomization of virtual memory (ASLR) is turned on in the kernel, thread migration may not work! Run 'echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space' as root to disable it, or try running with '+isomalloc_sync'.
Charm++> scheduler running in netpoll mode.
CharmLB> Load balancer assumes all CPUs are same.
Charm++> Running on 1 unique compute nodes (20-way SMP).
Charm++> cpu topology info is gathered in 0.000 seconds.
