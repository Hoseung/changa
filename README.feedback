The star formation/supernova feedback implemenation was translated
from Gasoline by Greg Stinson.  Note the following differences from
the Gasoline implementation that has been in common use from 2006
through 2010.  N.B. In all of the following, the definition of
"metals", "Oxygen" and "Iron" are not clear, and this may be the
origin of some of the noted differences.  E.g., does "Oxygen" refer to
the mass of O16 in particular or the mass of all the alpha elements.

* Upon reading a tipsy file which only has "metals",  the division of metals
  between "Oxygen", and "Iron" is 95% and 5% respectively, whereas in Gasoline
  this division was 75% and 25%.  XXX I (trq) have no idea why this change
  was made.

* SNIa eject all their mass in "metals", whereas Gasoline only ejects .76
  solar masses in "metals" per supernova.  My (trq) guess is that this change
  is related to confusion (probably in Gasoline) about the definitions noted
  above.
  
* The minimum mass of binary that can go supernova is .8 solar masses, whereas
  in Gasoline this is 3 solar masses.  The lowered limit allows SNIa's to
  continue happening for a very long time after star formation.

* In Gasoline, mass lost in SNIa is discounted against mass lost in winds.
  With the lower limit to SNIa binary masses noted above, which is below the
  lower mass limit for winds, there can be SNIa going off and no winds.
  Discounting SNIa mass loss against the wind mass loss would result in
  negative mass loss in winds, so it is not done.
